⚠️ Customization Instructions
Currently, personal details are directly hardcoded into the HTML and JavaScript files. To customize this template for your own use:
1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Riiishaab/Riiishaab.github.io.git
2. Open the project in your favorite code editor.
3. Manually replace my details with your own:
  -> Update your name, bio, contact info in index.html.  
  -> Replace project details and descriptions directly within HTML or JavaScript files.
  -> Adjust images/assets by replacing files within the assets folder.
Note: The current version requires manual editing step-by-step due to hardcoded information.

🚧 Future Improvements
-> Refactor the codebase to use variables or JSON objects for easier customization.
-> Modularize HTML components for better maintainability.
-> Implement automated data loading for simpler updates.
